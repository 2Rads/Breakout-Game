# Summary

This game was inspired from the Atari 2600 Breakout - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up-a5x3coC0

I created this project with Windows Forms in C# using Visual Studios.

# Features

From the initial requirements:
- The game has a single screen with 8 rows of blocks, a paddle, and a ball.  
- If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’. 
- After 5 lives, the game is over.  
- Every time the ball touches a block, the block disappears and the score increases.  
- The ball bounces off the paddle, the blocks, and the top, left and right edges of the screen.
- A pause button.
- A restart button.
- Alternating colours for each row of blocks.
- The ball bounces at different angles when it hits the paddle.
- A slight gap between blocks in a row.
